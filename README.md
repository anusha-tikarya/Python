## Introduction Of Python

Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, in the late 1980s. Guido van Rossum released the first version, Python 0.9.0, in February 1991.

The name "Python" was not inspired by the snake, but rather by the British comedy group Monty Python. Guido van Rossum was a fan of the show "Monty Python's Flying Circus," and he decided to name his programming language after it as a tribute to the comedy group. 

This repository covers essential topics such as variables, data types, control flow, functions, and more.
